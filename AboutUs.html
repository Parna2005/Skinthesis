<h1 id="id1">Our Name</h1>
<p id="id2">Skinthesis is a combination of two words - skin and photosynthesis. It symbolises the use of locally sourced organic ingredients to make skincare for Indian skin. 

    It also stands for synthesis of “skin” and “thesis”, symbolizing the fusion of research, innovation and old traditional remedies for  glowing and healthy skin.
    
    The name perfectly introduces the brand and its products.</p>

<h2 id="id1">Brand Personality</h2>
<p id="id2">We started this brand with the hopes of reaching the Indian audience. It is a small start up, being run out of the starter’s basement. All the products are made and assembled by hand and the materials are sourced from suppliers in bulk. The delivery is done via pre - existing systems.

    It is a gender neutral brand that promotes skincare for all, regardless of gender. Most of the marketing is done via social media platforms and word of mouth, and the products are sold via online store.</p>
